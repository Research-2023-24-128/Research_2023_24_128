The importance of soft skills has grown more and more clear in the quickly changing modern professional environment.Employers look for people who can collaborate, communicate effectively, and change with the times in addition to those who are technically proficient.The often-overlooked quality of focus, a cognitive function essential for sustained attention and task execution, is central to these soft skills.  Acknowledging the critical role that focus plays in forming soft skill sets as a whole, this study aims to perform a component analysis by exploring the subtleties of concentration using a gamified approach.  A break from conventional assessment techniques has been necessitated by the complexity of evaluating and quantifying soft skills.The addition of aspects from games into non gaming environments, or "gamification," shows promise as a way to increase participant engagement and collect quantitative data on cognitive processes.In this study, four unique games—Color Plate Game, Sudoku, a quiz app, and a memory game—that are purposefully created to target different aspects of focus are presented in an innovative application. We want to obtain a thorough grasp of how concentration affects and contributes to the wider range of soft skills through these gamified evaluations. By investigating the relationship between the concentration scores obtained from the gamified evaluation and the general soft skills demonstrated by potential employees, the study seeks to close the current gap in the literature. This study aims to improve the identification and development of soft skills necessary for success in the modern professional environment, with practical consequences for hiring practices and employee training initiatives. We go into further detail about the concentration analysis methods used in the next sections, as well as the goals and design of each game and the expected results.This study adds significant insights to the continuing conversation on cutting-edge and practical techniques for assessing and improving workforce abilities by illuminating the complex interplay between concentration and soft skills.This color plate is introduced by the famous psychologist John Ridley Stroop in 1930. Actual name of this game is Stroop.Despite the using same name, I refer to it as the Color Plate game here because the reasoning, technique, and analysis are the same. Adding originality was a crucial part of creating this game. The Color Plate game puts time above speed, in contrast to traditional games which emphasize time as a consideration. Our version of Stroop assesses time, while the standard game concentrates on speed. This game differs from others Stroop game in that speed is determined by the player's ability to focus. Furthermore, in keeping with the current study on concentration analysis, which frequently revolves around Sudoku, I have created a Sudoku game. Studies that use quantitative tests to evaluate concentration have resulted to the addition of an app called Quiz to assess employees' concentrate skills.The last component is the Memory Game, a properly named activity that evaluates concentration based on movements and timing for every participant candidate.
